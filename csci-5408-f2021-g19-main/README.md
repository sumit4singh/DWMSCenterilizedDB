# CentDB

Light-weight centralized database management system (e.g. metadata management, data structure design, data storing, retrieval, building database and logs, analysis, and security), with custom database structure for in memory operations using various data structures such as Arrays, Tree, Linked Lists etc., and custom file design for persistent storage.

**Note: All the database related files will be stored inside "centdb/" folder which is currently set to ignore using .gitignore file to avoid unnecessary merge conflict it can cause in development phase.**
